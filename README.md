Additionally, users can view a personalized feed, post updates or opportunities like investors and investment seekers, explore detailed profiles of businesses and investors, and apply for internships (paid or unpaid) or jobs in startups. This comprehensive system fosters a streamlined and collaborative experience, enabling investment givers and seekers to collaborate on promising projects, business ideas, and career opportunities
